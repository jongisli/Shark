 *  \brief Determines the RQ Decomposition of the matrix A using pivoting 
 *   returning the housholder transformation instead of Q.
 *
 * The pivoting RQ-Decomposition finds an orthonormal matrix Q and a lower Triangular matrix R
 * as well as a permuation matrix P such that PA = R*Q. 
 * Since Q is the multiplication of all householder transformations,
 * It is quite expensive to compute. Often, Q is only an intermediate step in computations which can be
 * carried out more efficiently using the Householder Transformations themselves.
 *
 * The Matrix format of the householder transform is that the transformations are stored as 
 * upper triangular matrix. The first transformation being in the first row and so on.

 * as well as a permuation matrix P such that PA = R*Q. 
 * This function is better known as the QR-Decomposition
 * of a transposed matrix B^T = A and B = QR. We depart from the well known algorithm
 * because it is intended to be used with column major matrices. But since shark uses
 * row-major, a QR decomposition is a lot slower. 
 *
 * This Version of the algorithm is based on householder transformations. since it uses pivoting it can
 * be used to determine the rank of a matrix.
